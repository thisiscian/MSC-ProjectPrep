News/Changes in iceWing
-----------------------

Version 0.11 (October 3 2012)
  - Added callbacks for all widgets. Any number of them can be attached to
    a widget and can be called when the widgets value changes or when the
    widget is removed.
  - The text of separator widgets is now bold, so it stands out more.
  - Set the size of the entry widget for int's based on the max allowed value.
  - New function opts_value_get() to get the value of a widget based on it's name.
  - Support _NET_WM_ICON: More window managers will now show a window icon.
  - New function iw_img_convert_layout() to convert between planar and
    interleaved images.
  - New function prev_copy_to_image() to get the content of a prevBuffer.
  - iw_img_yuvToRgbVis() supports interleaved images.
  - Added iw_opencv_render() for displaying OpenCv 2.x cv::Mat images directly.
  - Added iw_opencvMat_from_img(), iw_opencv_to_img(), and iw_opencv_to_img_interleaved()
    for conversion to/from OpenCv 2.x cv::Mat images.
  - Enhanced record plugin:
      - Support interleaved images.
      - New mode to automatically deactivate recording after one plugin round.
  - New CMake options to disable the autodetection of libraries.
  - Support xdg-open and okular for viewing the iceWing documentation.
  - Added RGB image display in the grab plugin.
  - New options "-nyuv" and "-nrgb" for the grab plugin to make output
    names of images configurable.
  - Enhanced handling of duplicated frames when compiled without FFmpeg.
  - Show only a warning and do not exit when grabbing an image did not work.
  - Remove any double entries in the grabbing options which are shown
    on the grabImage page.
  - Added new aravis grabbing driver, supporting GenICam compatible cameras.
  - Added new NET iCube grabbing driver.
  - Added new IDS Imaging uEye grabbing driver.
    Currently not all image widths are supported.
  - Enhanced firewire driver:
      - Added option 'propX' to set and get different properties.
      - The format7 ROI can be changed on the fly.
      - Option to set the iso speed.
      - Option to reset the bus before starting capturing.
      - Autodetection of the needed bayer pattern.
      - Always return the newest image in the queue for the dc1394 V2 library,
        as it was already done for the V1 library.
      - Optionally use the image embedded timestamp from different point grey cameras.
  - Enhanced V4L2 driver:
      - Support for additional pixel formats by using libv4lconvert for
        unknown formats.
      - It seems that for some cameras/drivers setting a property before
        grabbing an image does not take effect. So set the properties during
        opening the device and after grabbing the first image.
      - Do not fail but show only a warning if setting a property failed.
      - Grabbed color images can be interpreted as gray images with an
        increased width or height.
      - Correct/complete support for bool and menu properties.

      - On init try longer to get a valid image, the camera might take
        some time to get up.

  - Incompatible changes:
      - API cleanup: Removed different name spaces and exchanged them by
          the name space iw. There is a script
              icewing-api-update
          to adapt plugins. Start it with all source code files as
          parameters. The files are then adapted. For all changed
          files a backup 'file.bak' is created.
      - Removed deprecated global variable act_img and deprecated
        functions img_save(), img_save_raw(), img_save_interleaved_raw().
      - iwImage (formerly imgImage) contains now a pointer to an array
        of planes, instead of an array of 3 planes directly.
      - Changes of the grabImageData structure:
          - Contains the image directly, and not a pointer to the image.
          - downw, downh are now floats.
      - The value for the slider "Other.Image Num" is not saved anymore. But
        it is loaded and interpreted normally.
      - Moved the default configuration files ${HOME}/.icewing_session and
        ${HOME}/.icewing_value into an own directory, namely
        ${HOME}/.icewing/session and ${HOME}/.icewing/values

Version 0.8.1 (Mar 08 2005)
  - Some Bugfixes:
    - Fixed SegV during program exit if a camera could not be initialized.
    - Check that the GUI is initialized in opts_page_append() and prev_new_window().
    - Fixed prev_free_window().
    - Set all contour points during polygon filling.
    - Do not append a spurious space in plug_add_default_page().
    - Missing var init for region labeling.
    - Do not call the same plugin recursively if plug_add_default_page() is used.

Version 0.8 (Jan 19 2005)
  - Enhanced firewire driver:
      - Support for all format0/1/2 modes from 160x120 to 1600x1200.
      - Native support for RGB, gray, and gray16 grabbing.
      - Check available modes and automatically select a suitable one.
      - Decoding of interleaved stereo images.
      - Bayer decoding with three interpolation methods and all four bayer patterns.
        The interpolation methods: 1. downsampling
                                   2. nearest neighbor interpolation
                                   3. smooth hue transition interpolation
  
  - New options for the grabbing plugin,
      -rot to rotate the input image by 90/180/270 degree and
      -crop to crop the input image.
  
  - Loading of 16 bit png images and native support for gray level png images.
    16 bit saving was already available.
  
  - The session file can be auto saved at program exit.
  
  - Support for loading/saving pan and zoom values in session files.
  
  - Plugins can pan/zoom the image windows.
  
  - New tool in the image info window:
    Measure distances and angles in image windows.
  
  - Added support for subpixel exact rendering for the vector objects
    by using floats as coordinate types.
  
  - Added new data conversion mode for displaying high bit images:
    Shift the complete range to 0..255, can be selected in the image/Settings window.
  
  - Do not stop icewing if an image could not be loaded,
    just skip the problematic image.
  
  - Extended the max. allowed size of @file-files to about 3.8 MB.
  
  - Added new file set possibilities: If %t and/or %T is inside the
    fileset name, scan the complete directory for matching names.
  
  - Added debug_x(), warning_x(), error_x(), and assert_x().
  
  - Updated documentation.

Version 0.7 (Aug 16 2004)
  - All entries from the struct grabParameter (passed to the init
    function of all plugins), which belonged to the grabbing
    plugin, were removed.

  - All plugins are initialized in the order they were loaded.

  - Spaces, '(', and ')' are not allowed in ident and plugin names.

  - The grab plugin can be instantiated multiple times, This allows, for
    example, to use multiple cameras at the same time. Every instance
    has is own two queues of grabbed images and provides them to plugins
    and via DACS to external programs.

  - The grab plugin now stores additionally images in the RGB color space
    under the ident "imageRGB", if this ident is observed from any plugin.

  - Added plug_add_default_page(), which allows the user with the help
    of two widgets to
      - bypass the plugin process call and
      - to specify plugin dependencies for the plugin. The plugin gets
        then called one after another with the data from the specified
        plugins.

  - Added logging panel in the Plugin Info window.

  - Added display of a second position in the Info Window.

  - Menu hotkeys from the context menu of image windows are saved in the
    config file.

  - Added loading/saving/changing support for variables without any
    need for an associated widget.

  - Save images only if the corresponding window is open
    (for the entries in the image context menus).

  - Added initial MacOSX Support.

  - Added multiple instance support, imgImage support, and initial support
    for data types != IMG_8U to the record plugin.

  - Allow shell like word expansion in plugin options and in option
    config files.

  - Updated documentation.
