This directory contains different plugins for iceWing. Some of these plugins
are directly compiled into iceWing and some other are normal external
plugins. The makefile in this directory helps to build all external plugins
by calling successively all makefiles of all the external plugins.

Here is a short description of the plugins:

demo
    An external plugin demonstrating all widgets available in iceWing and
    the different render capabilities of iceWing.
min
    An external plugin showing the basic structure of an iceWing plugin.
min_cxx
    An external plugin showing the basic structure of an iceWing plugin. It's
    nearly identical to the min plugin besides that it uses the C++ plugin
    interface of iceWing.
record
    Compiled into iceWing. Performs optimized saving of images by using a
    second thread to write the images to disk.
remotectrl
    An external plugin which allows to remote control iceWing with an own
    socket based communication protocol and optionally with the XCF
    framework. The plugin provides two functions to get/set settings of
    iceWing widgets, similar to the iceWing '-of' option. See also the
    icewing-control program from the utils directory.
shmdata
    An external plugin which allows to distribute data via shared memory
    and local sockets to other local processes (1 to n communication).
    Supported are data elements of type grabImageData, iwImage, and char[].

The following plugins belong all to a project about hand segmentation
and tracking. They are all (a) compiled into iceWing, (b) somewhat old, and
(c) probably not really generally useful.

imgclass
    Performs color classification of the input image by using a lookup
    table.
skinclass
    Segment skin colored regions. Needs at least one other plugin to perform
    the real color classification.
backpro
    Perform color classification based on back projection. Needs the
    skinclass plugin.
gsimple
    Perform color classification with a gauss distribution. Needs the
    skinclass plugin.
polynom
    Perform color classification with a lookup table. This plugin needs the
    skinclass plugin.
tracking
    Track regions with a kalman filter. Needs the skinclass plugin.
