CMake, available from http://www.cmake.org/, is a utility to configure
a software package and generate build files for it. Version 2.4 or
newer of cmake can be used to build iceWing. 

Start CMake by "cmake .." from within this directory. CMake will then
create the necessary build files in this directory to compile iceWing
and install it to "/usr/local". Start the build process by "make" (or
"make VERBOSE=1" for a more verbose output) and the installation by
"make install".

To install iceWing to a different location, use
"cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=PATH_WHERE_ICEWING_SHOULD_BE_INSTALLED .."
For further installation instructions and general documentation please
refer to the file docs/icewing.pdf.
