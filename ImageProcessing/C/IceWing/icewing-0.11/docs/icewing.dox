The main user and programming documentation for iceWing can be found in the
iceWing distribution in the file <b>docs/icewing.pdf</b>. A good source of
information during programming of plugins provide the installed
<b>iceWing header</b> files. 

The doxygen documentation, which can be found here, is automatically extracted
from the header files. Due to this automatic process some documentation
comments may be incomplete compared to the header files.
