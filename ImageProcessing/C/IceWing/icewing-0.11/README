iceWing is a graphical plugin shell. Predefined or self-written
plugins operate hierarchically on pre-given data and can also generate
new data-streams. For image support there is e.g. a predefined plugin
for reading images from grabber-hardware, from the file system and
also from external, network wide processes.

Moreover, iceWing provides functions to easily create a user interface
for the plugins and to allow them to visualize results. The plugins
can create different widgets for data input and can open any number of
windows and display in these windows any data in a graphical form.

For further documentation and installation instructions please refer
to the file docs/icewing.pdf.
