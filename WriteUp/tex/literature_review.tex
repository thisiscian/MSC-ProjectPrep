  \section{Literature Review}
    The goal of this project is not unique.
    There have been solutions using other techniques before, that have been able to locate Wally.
    The first source found that solved the Where's Wally problem is a question posted on stackoverflow.com\cite{url:stackoverflowmathematica}.
    Within, a user inquires how to solve Where's Waldo (the american version) using Wolfram's Mathematica.
    The solution posted is extremely simple, and is highly popular, giving the poster 1180 reputation points (a measure of karma on the website).
    This has spawned off numerous articles and interpretations in different languages \cite{url:stackoverflowr,url:stackoverflowpython}
