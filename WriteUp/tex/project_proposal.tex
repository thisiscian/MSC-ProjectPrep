  \section{Project Proposal}
    This project will aim to create a parallelised solution of the Where's Wally puzzle.
    To do this, a solution using linear version of the code must be produced.
    Libraries implementing common Computer Vision techniques will be used.
    This should improve both the reliability of the code and the rate the programs can be written.
    The programs will be written in either C or C++.
    This is due to familiarity with the languages, and the quantity of readily availabile of computer vision libraries.
    Parallelism will be expressed through the use of either OpenMP or MPI.
    These libraries will be tested at an early stage to determine which produce the most efficient, readable code.
    The main goal of the project will be to produce a Where's Wally solver that can find a Wally with high reliability.
    This must also been done in at least the same time scale that a human can solve the puzzle.
